description: 'An Old Man''s Love, Trollope''s brief, final novel, was published posthumously
  in 1884. It concerns an admirable, middle-aged man, Mr. Whittlestaff, who loves
  a woman half his age and loses her to a less admirable, younger man. The novel is
  populated with Trollope''s humorous minor characters: Mr. Whittlestaff''s outspoken
  yet loyal housekeeper, Mrs Baggett, her drunken husband, and the Hall household,
  full of mirth and youth.'
